            <li>Put glutinous rice in a steamer and steam for 30 minutes, then simmer for 5 minutes. After that, take out the glutinous rice and stir well.</li>
            <li>Put the glutinous rice into the mould with banana leaves. Press it with a heavy object for at least 2 hours to make the glutinous rice cake firm. Slice it up and eat it.</li>
